            <p>Dear <%= @submission.name %>,</p>
            <p>Thank you for submitting your artwork for Artsy to consider. We always enjoy seeing fresh talent.</p>
            <p>Currently, we don’t work with artists directly. If you are represented by a gallery, you can encourage them to consider partnering with us.</p>
            <p>If you’re looking for gallery representation, you might be interested in reading our <%= link_to 'Gallery Representation Guide', 'https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-artists-gallery-representation', target: :_blank %> 
               and <%= link_to 'The Working Artist’s Guide', 'https://www.artsy.net/series/working-artists-guide', target: :_blank %>, two resources from our Editorial Team.</p>
            <p>We wish you all the best in your continued work.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Artsy</p>
